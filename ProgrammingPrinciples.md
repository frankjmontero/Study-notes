1. **You Aren’t Gonna Need It — YAGNI**. When adding code, make sure it’s needed right away. 

2. **Don’t Repeat Yourself — DRY**.Have a single source of truth. Having duplicated code is a waste. 

3. **Keep It Simple, Stupid — KISS.** Don’t overengineer. Sometimes the smartest solution is the easiest one.

4. **Big Design Up Front. **Before jumping into the implementation part, make sure it’s all well thought out.

5. **SOLID**
  - *Single-responsibility principle*. Every object, class, and method needs to have a single responsibility.
  - *Open–closed principle*. Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  - *Liskov substitution principle*. Objects of a superclass must be replaceable with objects of their subclasses, and the application should still work as expected.
  - *Interface segregation principle*. “Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use.” Robert C. Martin. The software should be split into multiple independents parts.
  - *Dependency inversion principle*. We should rely on abstractions, not on concrete implementations. The software should have low coupling and high cohesion. 

6. **Avoid Premature Optimization**.  Before going into the implementation details you need to check that those optimizations are really useful.

7. **Occam’s Razor**. Problem-solving principle that states: “entities should not be multiplied without necessity”. Don’t create unnecessary entities without them being needed.
