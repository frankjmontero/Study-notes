# Create a new Page

The component can have any name, but you must export it as a default export.

# `<Link>`

`<Link>` allows you to do client-side navigation to a different page in the application.

Note: If you need to link to an external page outside the Next.js app, just use an <a> tag without Link.

If you need to add attributes like, for example, className, add it to the a tag, not to the Link tag

In Next.js, you can add global CSS files by importing them from pages/_app.js. You cannot import global CSS anywhere else.
