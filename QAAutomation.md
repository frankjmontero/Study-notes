# **Tools**

Selenium, Web Driver.

# **Concepts**

## **What is testing?**
  
Process that include many diff activities mainly execution of tests and results checking, also test planning, analysis, design test, bug reporting, test reporting.

### **Testing and debugging**

Testing is not debugging

| Testing | Debugging |
|---|---|
| Fund bugs | Finds and fixes root cause of bugs |

## **Testing Principles**

1. Testing shows the presence of defects, not their absence
2. Exhaustive testing is impossible.
3. Early testing saves time and money.
1. Defects cluster together.
5. Beware of the pesticide paradox.
6. Testing is context dependent
7. Absence-of-errors is a fallacy.

## **QA automation**

Using a separate software to automatically perform tests for you to a piece of software.

## **Class of testing**

### **GUI testing**

Mimics the users interaction with the software. API testing. Tests the programming interface

### **Unit testing**

The easiest since you are testing the smallest pieces of software of the application.

## **Types of testing**

### **Integration test**

Multiple components are tested at once, through the code rather than the user interface. Questions that could answer: Does the software connects to the proper web service?

### **Functional test**

Tests the output disregarding the  internal functionality of the components.

### **Smoke test**

Test the stability and functionality of the build and its main features, 

### **End-to-end test**

Comprehensive test which is key to make sure the whole system works as intended.

### **Performance test**

Stability and speed with big data loads.

### **Regression test**

Confirms that new added features are no bringing old bugs back.
